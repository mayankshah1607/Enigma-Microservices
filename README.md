"Enigma" (by IEEE-VIT) implemented as a microservices architecture using Golang

> Note : This project was implemented as an experiment for me to get used to working with golang. This may not be used in production for future versions of Enigma.

Enigma is an online cryptic hunt conducted every year by [IEEE VIT Vellore](http://ieeevit.com). Participants have to solve a series of mind boggling questions to win cash prizes!
